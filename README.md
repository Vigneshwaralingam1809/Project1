# Enhancing Teaching Skills Using Big Data Analytics

## Project Overview

This project aims to help educators identify struggling students early and understand their learning patterns through the analysis of various data points such as attendance, assignment completion, quiz scores, and participation scores. By leveraging data analytics and clustering techniques, this project provides actionable insights that can be used to improve teaching effectiveness and better support students.

## Objective

- **Goal**: Identify learning patterns and provide insights to help educators support students who may need additional assistance.
- **Impact**: Early identification of students who are struggling can enable teachers to implement targeted interventions and improve overall student performance.

## Tools & Libraries

This project uses the following Python libraries:

- **Python**: Programming language
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning and clustering

## Dataset

The dataset is composed of 20 simulated student records with the following columns:

- **Attendance**: Percentage attendance of each student (0 to 100).
- **Assignments_Completed**: Number of assignments completed by each student.
- **Quiz_Avg_Score**: Average quiz score for each student (out of 100).
- **Exam_Score**: Final exam score for each student (out of 100).
- **Participation_Score**: Participation score based on engagement in class (out of 10).

## Code Structure

1. **Data Preparation**: Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Provides basic statistical analysis of the dataset to uncover insights.
3. **Clustering**: Uses K-means clustering to segment students into clusters based on their performance and behavior.
4. **Analysis**: Interprets the characteristics of each cluster and offers recommendations for targeted teaching interventions.

## Requirements

Before running the project, install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vigneshwaralingam1809/enhancing-teaching-skills-big-data-analytics.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd enhancing-teaching-skills-big-data-analytics
```

3. **Run the script**:

```bash
python project1.py
```

This will run the Python script, and youâ€™ll see basic statistics and cluster summaries for the students. The script will also generate visualizations to help analyze student performance patterns.

## Example Output

The script generates the following outputs:

- **Basic Statistics**: A summary of the data, such as the mean, standard deviation, and quartiles of student performance metrics.
- **Cluster Analysis**: A K-means clustering result that segments students into different clusters, each with its unique characteristics (e.g., low attendance or low exam scores).
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations of the data and clusters to aid in understanding the patterns.

## Getting Started with GitHub
